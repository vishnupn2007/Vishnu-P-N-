Audio - Visual Morse code generator built in python with user friendly interface.

Build dependencies: 
1.tkinter module 
2.threading module
3.sounddevice module 
4.numpy module 
5.time module (Pre-installed in python)

Approach:
It uses a casual pre-stored dictionary that contains the morse codes of correspoding characters.
Running a loop to form a string of morse codes for the given string.
Generating a sound i.e, a sine waveform and storing it in a variable so that it can be played when required for dot and dash.
Threading - to run audio and morse code simultaneouly.
Tkinter - to have a user friendly experience.
Exceution: Run the file by usual method of clicking the play button or python JACKfruit.py

Improvement: Needs precision in the context of time delay.

Note: Add an image of your choice by replacing your image name with "mon.jpg" line - 79 placing the image file in the same directory where the morse code program is added to
